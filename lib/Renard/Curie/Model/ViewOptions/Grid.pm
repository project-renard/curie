=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 rows

  Maybe[PositiveInt]

The number of rows for the grid (i.e., in the vertical direction)
or C<undef> if the number of rows is unspecified (see C<BUILD>).

=head2 columns

  Maybe[PositiveInt]

The number of columns for the grid (i.e., in the horizontal direction)
or C<undef> if the number of columns is unspecified (see C<BUILD>).

=head2 is_continuous_view

  Bool

A predicate that returns a true value if the view is a continuous view
(see C<BUILD>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 BUILD

This class can only be constructed if at least one of C<rows> or C<columns> is
defined. If one is C<undef>, the associated grid view is continuous and the
non-C<undef> attribute is used to compute the C<undef> attribute.
